## 1. Translating Business Requirements into Technical Architecture

To effectively translate business requirements into technical architecture, we use **Draw.io**, a powerful diagramming tool.

### Steps to Use Draw.io
1. **Open Draw.io**: Visit [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io) and choose to use it online or download the desktop version.
2. **Create a New Diagram**: Select "Create New Diagram" and choose a blank or pre-defined template.
3. **Define Business Requirements**: List all requirements, such as user needs, performance metrics, or compliance goals.
4. **Translate Requirements into Architecture**:
   - **Components**: Drag and drop elements like AKS clusters, Kubernetes pods, and networking components.
   - **Connections**: Use arrows to show interactions between components.
   - **Annotations**: Add labels and text to explain each component's purpose.
5. **Save and Share**: Export your diagram in formats like PNG, SVG, or PDF and share it with stakeholders.

## 2. Presenting Your Architecture

Effectively presenting your architecture is crucial for stakeholder understanding and approval.

### Tips for a Successful Presentation
- **Start with an Overview**: Provide a high-level summary of the architecture.
- **Break It Down**: Explain each component and its role in the system.
- **Use Visual Aids**: Include diagrams (e.g., from Draw.io) to simplify complex concepts.
- **Highlight Key Points**: Focus on scalability, security, and integration.
- **Prepare for Q&A**: Anticipate questions and have detailed answers ready.

## 3. Deploying a Basic AKS Cluster

### Prerequisites
Before deploying an AKS cluster, ensure the following:
- **Kubernetes Basics**: Familiarize yourself with [Kubernetes core concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads).
- **Azure Subscription**: Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you donâ€™t already have one.
- **Azure Cloud Shell**: Review the [Azure Cloud Shell Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

### Steps to Deploy an AKS Cluster
1. **Access Azure Portal**: Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. **Create a New AKS Cluster**:
   - Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Kubernetes Service."
   - Fill in details like Subscription, Resource Group, and Cluster Name.
   - Choose the "Dev/Test" profile for a sandbox environment.

3. **Configure Cluster Settings**:
   - **Node Pools**: Set the number of nodes and VM size.
   - **Authentication**: Use default settings for Azure AD or Kubernetes RBAC.
   - **Review and Create**: Verify settings and click "Create."
4. **Access the Cluster**: Use Azure CLI or the Kubernetes dashboard to manage the cluster.

## 4. Deploying the AKS Demo Store

Deploying the AKS demo store involves setting up a sample application on your AKS cluster.

### Steps for Deployment
1. **Prepare the Application**:
   - Obtain the [YAML source code](aks-store-quickstart.yaml).
   - Use the Azure Cloud Shell editor to create Kubernetes manifests.
   - Follow the "Connect to AKS Cluster" workflow in the Azure portal.

2. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Run `kubectl apply -f <manifest-file>.yaml` to apply the manifests.
   - Monitor the deployment with `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services`.
   - Example terminal output:
     ```
     deployment.apps/rabbitmq created
     service/rabbitmq created
     deployment.apps/order-service created
     service/order-service created
     deployment.apps/product-service created
     service/product-service created
     deployment.apps/store-front created
     service/store-front created
     ```
3. **Access the Application**:
   - Check pod status with `kubectl get pods` (ensure all pods are running).
   - Find the public IP of the store-front service using `kubectl get service --watch`.
   - Example output:
     ```
     NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
     store-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.200.10   40.62.155.23   80:30025/TCP   9m
     ```
   - Open the public IP in your browser to access the store app.
